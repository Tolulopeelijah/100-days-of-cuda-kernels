Why the usage of CUDA
I learn about what host function and what device functions mean
I learnt how to write a simple kernel and compile using NVCC
I learnt some few cuda keywords and their parameters: cudaMalloc, cudaFree
I learnt the concept of moving data from host to device and back to device after parallel processing on the device
